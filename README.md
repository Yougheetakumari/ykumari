# GitHub Pages Portfolio Starter

A minimal, dark, card-based portfolio that matches the attached design.
Place these files in the root of your repo and enable GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Copy all files to your repo (e.g., `yourusername.github.io`).
2. Commit and push.
3. In GitHub → Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch: `main`.
4. Edit `index.html`:
   - Replace **Your Name**, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links.
   - Update the **About** paragraph.
   - Add or edit job cards in the **Experience** section.
   - Replace project cards and links.

No build tools needed; it is plain HTML + CSS.
